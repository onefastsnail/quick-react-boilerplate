# A React boilerplate example

Just a simple React app, to help others learn React and its flow of data. Using a local API to create some async calls to show callbacks, emmiting events, and stores that listen to events which trigger further events for components to listen to these changes, and therefore the React :)

Will update more soon, this was just a quick example for now. 

## Usage

* npm install
* gulp
* And Enjoy :)
